# Social-Media-Influencers

PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:

The objective of our project is to design a database of social media influencers catering to business marketing needs. The scope of our project includes records on the influencer's reach, type of content, and origin of content amongst other things. This sophisticated system can further be used to deduce and match which social media influencer is a good fit for advertising businesses based on many criteria including the budget, target audience, target region, and more.  This system will work with multiple social media platforms and recommend the best content creators from each of the platforms that match the business needs. We will work towards assimilating and manipulating this data and getting the required insights in the most efficient and clean way.

DELIVERABLES:

1. Database of social media influencers from platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook 
2. Sophisticated queries to pull optimal results across various platforms based on multiple complex criterions like:

    a) Budget: Influencers will be recommended based on the budget set by the business
  
    b) Category: Based on the niche the business is based in, our database will recommend the most optimal influencer matches.
  
    c) Demographic: Depending on the target location for the campaign, the query will provide the most suited influencers based on the target region.
  
    d) Engagements: Pertaining to how much engagement the influencer has per post on average, our database will display the most optimally matching results.
  
    e) Reach: On the basis of the influencer's followers/Subscribers, our database will find the best-matched targets according to the business needs of the organization.
  
3. Recommending the best influencers from various social media platforms to the businesses as per their requirements.
 

LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS:

1. The Database will not reflect real-time data; we shall be using a dataset from Kaggle.
2. The database will only function unidirectionally where in we will recommend the best-matched influencers to businesses but it won't work the other way where we recommend businesses to the influencers.
